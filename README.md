# objectAandB
Very simple simulation of radiation between two cylinders (A and B) of the same dimensions separated by some distance.
Only radiation is considered (perfect vacuum).

Object A at temp T
Object B at temp < T
Assumes that these objects are otherwise identical
Assumes that they are black bodies
Assumes these are cylinders and ignore the top ends
  radius r
  height h
  separation d
  d > r
Assumes that the temperature of the surroundings is unchanged.
Assumes that no additional energy is being added.
  That is to say the two objects are heated to their starting temps
  independantly, then the power is switched off and they are
  immediately brought together.
Assumes that the temperature of each object is uniform.
  So they radiate in a uniform way around the cylinder.
Assumes constant specific heat capacities (non temperature or time dependant).
Assumes unchanged volumes.

And probably a bunch of other things.

Not really useful for anything (can help imagining this kind of situation), I'd probably recommend ignoring this.
